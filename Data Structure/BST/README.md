Primary objectives of this program
---
1. Implement a binary search tree and four operators: search, insertion, deletion and enumeration.
2. Implement a stack class to assist the implementation of enumeration.

Program Input and Output
---
1. An arbitrary sequence of non-repeated integer keys, ended with ‘s’. These keys will be used to construct the initial tree.
2. An integer indicating which operation to perform on the current tree.
  a. 1 indicates searching for a key.
  b. 2 indicates inserting a key.
  c. 3 indicates deleting a key.
3. A key, x, associated with the operator
  a. if the task is search, then x can be arbitrary and won’t be processed inside the program.
  b. if the task is insertion, then x is the key to insert.
  c. if the task is deletion, then x is the key to delete.
